# Disaster-Response-Pipelines
# Project Motivation
This project (Disaster Response Pipelines) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.
In this project, we will build a model to classify messages that are sent during disasters. There are 36 pre-defined categories, and examples of these categories include (related	request,	offer,	aid_related	,medical_help	,medical_products etc...).
This project will involve the building of a basic ETL and Machine Learning pipeline to facilitate the task and finally web app to represent results.
